### Navigating The Map
--------------------------------
The screen you are first taken to after starting a game is the map screen. This map is made up of individual nodes organized into columns. Your goal is to travel from the left most node to the right most node. You can only travel to the right, losing access to all previous nodes and all other nodes within your current column. When traveling to a node you will either have a new combat encounter to face or an event of some kind.
(dark blue node: currently occupied; light blue node: available to be traveled to; black node: inaccessible; light gray node: out of reach)

<br />


### Unit Summoning
--------------------------------
Combat will start with you only having one unit, your commander, but additional units can be summoned through the summoning menu. To use the summoning menu: first select the tile you with the unit to be summoned onto (it must be within the movement range of your commander), open the summoning menu by pressing tab (or clicking the rectangle along the left edge of the screen), then click the unit you wish to summon.

Summoned units cannot act on the turn they are summoned, and your are limited on the number you may summon by the "summoning stones", the number of which you have is visible at the bottom of the summoning menu.

<br />


### Ending Your Turn
--------------------------------
To end your turn simply press the "End Turn" bottom near the bottom right of the screen. This will allow the computer enemy to take it's turn, and then begin your next turn, allowing all units to move and attack again.

<br />


### Winning / Losing
--------------------------------
To win a combat encounter you must defeat all enemy units, and you lose once your commander unit has been defeated.
To win the entire game you must travel to the furthest right node.
